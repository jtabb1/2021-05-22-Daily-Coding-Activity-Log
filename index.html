    <p>
      Today I worked on two projects.  I worked on the first project 
      long enough for me to determine that I ought to stop working 
      on it and work on the second project.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent more time working on the second project today.  I feel 
      that I will make more progress on it and use what I learned in 
      it to help me do the first project better.
